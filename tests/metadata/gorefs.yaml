  title: Gene Ontology annotation through association of InterPro records with GO
    terms.
  description: |-
    InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) is an integrated resource from the EBI of protein families, domains and sites which are combined from a number 
    of different protein signature databases, including Gene3D, Panther, PRSF, Pfam, PRINTS, ProSite, ProDom, SMART, SUPERFAMILY and TIGRFAMs. Signatures describing the same protein 
    family or domain are grouped into unique InterPro entries. When appropriate, the InterPro team maps InterPro entries to  GO terms (Molecular Function, Biological Process and/or Cellular Component). 
    InterPro runs InterProScan on the entire set of UniProt proteins. InterPro hits are assigned the corresponding GO annotations by the GOA pipeline. The mapping file is available at http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/external2go/interpro2go.
  comments:
    - Note that some groups filter GO annotations based on InterPro-to-GO transitive assignment, e.g. to remove annotations redundant with manual curation.

  title: Gene Ontology annotation based on Enzyme Commission mapping
  description: |-
    In UniProt, proteins with enzymatic activities have traditionally been annotated using reference vocabularies such as the hierarchical enzyme classification of the Enzyme Nomenclature Committee of the IUBMB 
    (often referred to as Enzyme Commission or EC numbers; https://enzyme.expasy.org/). EC numbers are manually curated in Swiss-Prot ('UniProt Reviewed') entries and added automatically to 
    TrEMBL ('UniProt Uneviewed') entries. A mapping between EC numbers and GO Molecular Function terms is maintainted by GO editors. UniProt entries assigned with an EC number
    with a GO mapping are automatically annotated with the correponding GO term, as described in PMID:30395331. GO annotations using this method receive the evidence code 
    Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA). This method has been evaluated at up to 100% accurate (Camon et. al. 2005). The EC2GO mapping file is available at
    http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/external2go/ec2go.

  description: |-
    Transitive assignments using UniProtKB keywords. The UniProtKB keyword
    controlled vocabulary has been created and used by the UniProt Knowledgebase
    (UniProtKB) to supply 10 different categories of information to UniProtKB entries.
    Further information on the UniProtKB keyword resource can be found at
    http://www.uniprot.org/docs/keywlist.

    Further information on the UniProt annotation methods is available at
    https://www.uniprot.org/help/manual_curation and
    https://www.uniprot.org/help/automatic_annotation.

    When a UniProtKB keyword describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene
    Ontology, it is investigated to determine whether it is appropriate to map the
    keyword to an equivalent term in GO. The mapping between UniProtKB keywords and
    GO terms is carried out manually. Definitions and hierarchies of the terms in the
    two resources are compared and the mapping generated will reflect the most correct
    correspondence. The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB keywords is

    associated with the orthologous gene(s) to the mouse gene. Only those GO terms
    assigned by experimental determination to the ortholog of the mouse gene will
    be adopted by MGI. GO terms that are assigned to the ortholog of the mouse gene

  title: Hidden Markov Models (TIGR)
  description: |-
    A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical representation of patterns found
    in a data set. When using HMMs with proteins, the HMM is a statistical model of
    the patterns of the amino acids found in a multiple alignment of a set of proteins
    called the "seed". Seed proteins are chosen based on sequence similarity to each
    other. Seed members can be chosen with different levels of relationship to each
    other. They can be members of a superfamily (ex. ABC transporter, ATP-binding
    proteins), they can all share the same exact specific function (ex. biotin synthase)
    or they could share another type of relationship of intermediate specificity (ex.
    subfamily, domain). New proteins can be scored against the model generated from
    the seed according to how closely the patterns of amino acids in the new proteins
    match those in the seed. There are two scores assigned to the HMM which allow
    annotators to judge how well any new protein scores to the model. Proteins scoring
    above the "trusted cutoff" score can be assumed to be part of the group defined
    by the seed. Proteins scoring below the "noise cutoff" score can be assumed to
    NOT be a part of the group. Proteins scoring between the trusted and noise cutoffs
    may be part of the group but may not. One of the important features of HMMs is
    that they are built from a multiple alignment of protein sequences, not a pairwise
    alignment. This is significant, since shared similarity between many proteins
    is much more likely to indicate shared functional relationship than sequence similarity
    between just two proteins. The usefulness of an HMM is directly related to the
    amount of care that is taken in chosing the seed members, building a good multiple
    alignment of the seed members, assessing the level of specificity of the model,
    and choosing the cutoff scores correctly. In order to properly assess what functional
    relevance an above-trusted scoring HMM match has to a query, one must carefully
    determine what the functional scope of the HMM is. If the HMM models proteins
    that all share the same function then it is likely possible to assign a specific
    function to high-scoring match proteins based on the HMM. If the HMM models proteins
    that have a wide variety of functions, then it will not be possible to assign
    a specific function to the query based on the HMM match, however, depending on
    the nature of the HMM in question, it may be possible to assign a more general
    (family or subfamily level) function. In order to determine the functional scope
    of an HMM, one must carefully read the documentation associated with the HMM.
    The annotator must also consider whether the function attributed to the proteins
    in the HMM makes sense for the query based on what is known about the organism
    in which the query protein resides and in light of any other information that
    might be available about the query protein. After carefully considering all of
    these issues the annotator makes an annotation.

  title: Pairwise alignment (TIGR)
  description: |-
    Pairwise alignments are generated by taking two sequences and aligning them so
    that the maximum number of amino acids in each protein match, or are similar to,
    each other. Tools such as BLAST work by comparing a protein-of-interest individually
    with every protein in a database of known protein sequences and retaining only
    those matches with a high probability of being significant. Basic BLAST generates
    local alignments between proteins for regions of high similarity. Other pairwise
    alignment tools attempt to generate global (full-length) protein alignments. A
    tool called Blast_Extend_repraze (BER, http://ber.sourceforge.net) has some benefits
    over basic BLAST. Input into the BER tool includes the underlying DNA sequence
    for each protein as well as 300 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the predicted
    boundaries of the protein coding sequence. This allows annotators to see the DNA
    sequence that underlies the query protein as part of the alignment. In addition,
    the BER tool is able to look for continuation of regions of similarity through
    frameshifts and in-frame stop codons.  If such regions are found the alignment
    is continued. BER searches are done in a two-step process: step one is a BLAST
    search against a non-redundant protein database, significant BLAST hits are stored
    in a mini-database for each query protein; step two is a modified Smith-Waterman
    alignment between the query and the proteins in its mini-database. In order to
    assess whether a given BER alignment is good enough to assert that the query shares
    the function of the match protein, one must look at a several factors. First of
    all, the match protein must itself be experimentally characterized in order to
    avoid transitive annotation errors. In addition, any residues or secondary structures
    known to be important for function in the match protein must be conserved in the
    query. The alignment should be visually inspected to look for any areas of lesser
    quality that might indicate the two proteins do not share the same function. Although
    it is impossible to set cutoff values for percent identity and length of match
    that will apply for every alignment, there are some guidelines. In general at
    least 40% identity that extends over the full lengths of both proteins is required
    in order to even consider functional equivalence. However, this percentage is
    highly dependent on the length and complexity of the proteins. 40% identity between
    two proteins 500 amino acids long is much more significant that 40% identity between
    two proteins that are only 100 amino acids long. Therefore, the annotator's experience
    and knowledge of what is considered significant for the organism and protein family
    in question is very important. Some sets of proteins are much more highly conserved
    than others and therefore tolerances for percent identity may have to be adjusted.
    Finally, the alignment must be considered in the context of what else is known
    about the query protein and the organism as a whole.

    Current genetic and molecular studies in many model organisms are aimed at understanding

    In June 2006, curators from MGI and ZFIN met with researchers studying central
    nervous system development to improve the representation of these processes in
    GO. In particular, emphasis was placed on three areas that are being addressed
    actively in current research: forebrain development, hindbrain development and
    neural tube development. This collaboration resulted in the addition of over 500
    terms that reflect the development of the forebrain, the hindbrain, and the neural
    tube from the perspective of biological process and anatomical structure.

  title: Improving the representation of immunology in the biological process Ontology

    GO terms describing processes, functions, and cellular components related to the
    immune system have existed in the GO from its beginning and been used extensively
    in the annotation of gene products. However, particularly in the biological process
    ontology, the initial set of terms relating to immunology failed to cover the
    breadth of known immunological processes, and in many cases diverged from current
    usage and understanding in their names, definitions, and ontological placement.
    As part of a larger effort to improve the representation of immunology in the
    GO, a GO Content Meeting was held November 15-16, 2005, at The Institute for Genomic
    Research, to discuss improvements to representation of immunology in the biological
    process ontology of the GO. As a result of the meeting, a number of high level
    terms for immunological processes were created, an overall structure for immunologically
    related terms was established, and certain existing terms were renamed or redefined
    as well to bring them in line with current usage.

  title: Manual transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to orthologs
    by curator judgment of sequence similarity.
  description: |-
    Method for transferring manual annotations to an entry based on a curator's judgment
    of its similarity to a putative ortholog that has annotations that are supported
    with experimental evidence. Annotations are created when a curator judges that
    the sequence of a protein shows high similarity to another protein that has annotation(s)
    supported by experimental evidence (and therefore display one of the evidence
    codes EXP, IDA, IGI, IMP, IPI or IEP). Annotations resulting from the transfer
    of GO terms display the 'ISS' evidence code and include an accession for the protein
    from which the annotation was projected in the 'with' field (column 8). This field
    can contain either a UniProtKB accession or an IPI (International Protein Index)
    identifier. Only annotations with an experimental evidence code and which do not
    have the 'NOT' qualifier are transferred. Putative orthologs are chosen using
    information combined from a variety of complementary sources. Potential orthologs
    are initially identified using sequence similarity search programs such as BLAST.
    Orthology relationships are then verified manually using a combination of resources
    including sequence analysis tools, phylogenetic and comparative genomics databases
    such as Ensembl Compara, INPARANOID and OrthoMCL, as well as other specialised
    databases such as species-specific collections (e.g. HGNC's HCOP). In all cases
    curators check each alignment and use their experience to assess whether similarity
    is considered to be strong enough to infer that the two proteins have a common
    function so that they can confidently project an annotation. While there is no
    fixed cut-off point in percentage sequence similarity, generally proteins which
    have greater than 30% identity that covers greater than 80% of the length of both
    proteins are examined further. For mammalian proteins this cut-off tends to be
    higher, with an average of 80% identity over 90% of the length of both proteins.
    Strict orthologs are desirable but not essential. In general, when there is evidence
    of multiple paralogs for a single species, annotations using less specific GO
    terms are transferred to the paralogs, however, annotations using more specific
    GO terms may be transferred to the most similar paralog in each species, this
    decision is taken on a case by case basis and may be influenced by statements
    by researchers in the field. Further detailed information on this procedure, including
    how ISS annotations are made to protein isoforms, can be found at:
    https://wiki.geneontology.org/Inferred_from_Sequence_or_structural_Similarity_(ISS).

  title: Operon structure as IGC evidence
  description: |-
    Genes in prokaryotic organisms are often arranged in operons. Genes in an operon
    are all transcribed into one mRNA. Generally the genes in the operons code for
    proteins that all have related functions. For example, they may be the steps in
    a biochemical pathway, or they may be the subunits of a protein complex. Often
    the genes in operons shared between organisms are syntenic; that is, the same
    genes are in the same order in the operon in different species. When assessing
    sequence-comparison-based evidence during the process of manual annotation of
    a genome, it is often the case that some of the genes in the operon will have
    strong sequence-based evidence while others will have weak evidence. If seen alone,
    not in the presence of an operon, the weak evidence in question may not be sufficient
    to make a functional annotation. However, in the presence of an operon in which
    there is strong evidence for some of the genes, the very presence of the gene
    in the operon is a strong indication that the gene shares in the process carried
    out by the operon. If the putative function is one expected to exist for the process
    in question and particularly if that function has been observed in the same operon
    in another species, then the annotation should be made. This type of evidence
    is inferred from the context of the gene in an operon, and therefore the evidence
    code is IGC "inferred from genomic context."

    provide a comprehensive representation of muscle biology in the biological process
    and cellular component ontologies and to improve the organization of muscle-specific
    terms to better describe the current knowledge of biological mechanisms in muscle
    tissue. Thus, the collaboration brought together experts in several areas of muscle
    biology and physiology who carried out a thorough review of the existing GO muscle
    terms as these terms were largely created by non-muscle experts using older definitions.
    In particular, several areas are being addressed actively in current research:
    the biological processes of muscle contraction, muscle plasticity, muscle development,
    and muscle regeneration; and the sarcoplasmic reticulum and membrane delimited
    compartments. This work resulted in the addition of 159 new terms and in the modification
    of 57 terms to bring them in line with current usage. Funding for the meeting
    was provided by Italian Telethon Foundation.

  title: BLAST search criteria for ISS assignment in PAMGO_GAT
  description: |-
    This GO reference describes the criteria used in assigning the evidence code of
    ISS via BLAST searches to annotate gene products from PAMGO_GAT. Standard BLASTP
    from NCBI was used (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast) to query the non-redundant
    (NR) database. Hits are considered to be significant if the E-value is at or less
    than 10^-4. All other parameters are default according to http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast.

    This GO reference describes the criteria used in assigning the evidence codes
    of IDA (ECO:0000314), IEP (ECO:0000270), ISS (ECO:0000250), IGC (ECO_0000317),
    RCA (ECO:0000245) and IEA (ECO:0000501) to annotate gene products from PAMGO_MGG.
    Standard BLASTP from NCBI was used (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast) to iteratively
    search reciprocal best hits and thus identify orthologs between predicted proteins
    of Magnaporthe grisea and GO proteins from multiple organisms with published association
    to GO terms. The alignments were manually reviewed for those hits with e-value
    equal to zero and with 80% or better coverage of both query and subject sequences,
    and for those hits with e<=10^-20, pid >=35 and sequence coverage >=80%. Furthermore,
    experimental or reviewed data from literature and other sources were incorporated
    into the GO annotation. IDA was assigned to an annotation if normal function of
    its gene was determined through transfections into a cell line and overexpression.
    IEP was assigned to an annotation if according to microarray experiments, its
    gene was upregulated in a biological process and the fold change was equal to
    or bigger than 10, or if according to Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing
    (MPSS), its gene was upregulated only in a certain biological process and the
    fold change was equal to or bigger than 10. ISS was assigned to an annotation
    if the entry at the With_column was experimentally characterized and the pairwise
    alignments were manually reviewed. IGC was assigned to an annotation if it based
    on comparison and analysis of gene location and structure, clustering of genes,
    and phylogenetic reconstruction of these genes. RCA was assigned to an annotation
    if it based on integrated computational analysis of whole genome microarray data,
    and matches to InterPro, pfam, and COG etc. IEA was assigned to an annotation
    if its function assignment based on computational work, and no manual review was
    done.

  title: OBSOLETE Portable Annotation Rules
  description: |-
    The JCVI is developing a collection of mixed-evidence annotation rules, under
    the working name BrainGrab/RuleBase (BGRB). A rule has two parts. The first is
    the set of conditions that must be met for the rule to fire. The second is the
    set actions to be taken for rules that have fired. BGRB rules are designed to
    serve as proxies for the annotators that create them. They have very high fidelity
    but may have low coverage. Types of evidence used in combination include HMM hits
    and BLAST matches, hits to neighboring genes, pathway reconstruction reports from
    the Genome Properties system, and species taxonomy. BLAST matches are described
    by a number of separate parameters for raw score, percent sequence identity, and
    coverage of total sequence length by the match region. These parameters are customized
    for each protein family in order to achieve high fidelity in automated annotation
    systems. The flexible syntax makes it possible to use existing protein family
    classifiers, such as Pfam and TIGRFAMs HMMs, in new ways. It is especially useful
    in assigning GO terms to proteins such as SelD (selenide, water dikinase) that
    have different roles in different contexts.

  description: |-
    The Phylogenetic ANnotation using Gene Ontology (PAN-GO) method annotates evolutionary
    trees from the PANTHER database with GO terms describing molecular function, biological
    process and cellular component. The GO terms are manually selected by a curator
    and used to annotate ancestral genes in the phylogenetic tree using the evidence
    code IBA (Inferred from Biological Ancestor). All supporting annotations must
    be based on experimental data from the scientific literature. The PAN-GO annotations
    are fully traceable from the data in the 'with/from' column of the annotation,
    which provides the PANTHER node ID (PTN) from which the annotation is derived,
    as well as all descendants sequences that support the annotation of the ancestral
    node.

    The full method is described in PMID:21873635.

    between orthologs that have at least a 40% peptide identity to each other. Only
    GO annotations with an evidence type of IDA, IEP, IGI, IMP or IPI are projected,
    no annotations with a 'NOT' qualifier are projected and annotations to the GO:0005515
    protein binding term are not projected. Projected GO annotations using this technique
    will receive the evidence code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA). The

  title: Manual annotations that require more than one source of functional data to
    support the assignment of the associated GO term
  description: |-
    The Gene Ontology Consortium uses the IC (Inferred by Curator) evidence code when
    an annotation cannot be supported by any direct evidence, but can be inferred
    by GO annotations that have been annotated to the same gene/gene product identifier
    in conjunction with the curator's knowledge of biology (supporting GO annotations
    must not be IC-evidenced). In many cases an IC-evidenced annotation simply applies
    the same reference that was used in the supporting GO annotation.  The use of
    IC evidence code in an annotation with reference GO_REF:0000036 signifies a curator
    inferred the GO term based on evidence from multiple sources of evidence/GO annotations.
    The 'with/from' field in these annotations will therefore supply more than one
    GO identifier, obtained from the set of supporting GO annotations assigned to
    the same gene/gene product identifier which cite publicly-available references.

    annotation is made based on curator judgement from manually reviewing the sequence
    of the gene product and where no publication can be found to support the curators
    conclusion. It is preferable to cite a peer-reviewed publication (such as a PubMed
    identifier) for IKR-evidenced annotations whenever possible. Curators will have
    carefully reviewed the sequence of the annotated protein, and established that
    the key residues known to be required for an expected activity or location are
    not present. Inclusion of an identifier in the 'with/from' field, that highlights
    to the user the lacking residues(e.g. an alignment, domain or rule identifier)
    is absolutely required when annotating to IKR with this GO_REF. Documentation

  title: OBSOLETE TIGR's Eukaryotic Manual Gene Ontology Assignment Method
  description: |-
    This describes TIGR curators' interpretation of a combination of evidence. Our
    internal software tools present us with a great deal of evidence based on domains,
    sequence similarities, signal sequences, paralogous proteins, etc. The curator
    interprets the body of evidence to make a decision about a GO assignment when
    an external reference is not available. The curator places one or more accessions
    that informed the decision in the "with" field.

  title: OBSOLETE Automatic transfer of experimentally verified manual GO annotation
    data to fungal orthologs using Ensembl Compara
  description: |-
    GO terms from a source species are projected onto one or more target species based
    on gene orthology obtained from the Ensembl Compara system. One to one, one to
    many and many to many orthologies are used but annotations are only projected
    between orthologs that have at least a 40% peptide identity to each other. Only
    GO annotations with an evidence type of IDA, IEP, IGI, IMP or IPI are projected,
    no annotations with a 'NOT' qualifier are projected and annotations to the GO:0005515
    protein binding term are not projected. Projected GO annotations using this technique
    will receive the evidence code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA). The
    model organism database identifier of the annotation source will be indicated
    in the 'With' column of the GOA association file.

  title: Manual transfer of GO annotation data to genes by curator judgment of sequence
    model
  description: |-
    Transitive assignment of GO terms to a gene based on a curator's judgment of its
    match to a sequence model,such as a Pfam or InterPro entry, that has manually
    curated GO annotations, mappings to GO terms, or a description from which GO terms
    can be inferred. A statistical model of a sequence or group of sequences is used
    to make a prediction about the function of a protein or RNA. Annotations are created
    when a curator evaluates the results, using criteria that include excluding false
    positives and ensuring that the annotation is accurate for all matches. Statistical
    scores (such as e values and cutoff scores) and the functional specificity of
    the model may also be (but are not always) considered. Annotations resulting from
    the transfer of GO terms use the 'ISM' evidence code and include an accession
    for the model from which the annotation was projected in the 'with' field (column
    8).

  title: Gene Ontology annotation based on curation of immunofluorescence data

    GO Cellular Component terms are manually assigned by curators studying

    generation of affinity-purified antibodies with protein profiling in a variety
    of cells and tissues. Further information on the annotation methods can be found
    at http://www.proteinatlas.org/about/assays+annotation

    Annotations are only
    exported to the GO Consortium if the localizations are supported by literature,
    according to the following validation grading:

    Supportive - Subcellular localization
    supported by literature.

    1) One/multiple localizations supported by literature.
    2) Multiple localizations partly supported (at least one) by literature.
    3) One/multiple
    localizations in cytoplasm (i.e. Golgi, mitochondria, ER etc) with literature
    supporting cytoplasmic localization.

  description: |-
    We use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elk-reasoner/">ELK reasoner</a> as
    part of an ontology development and release pipeline to automatically construct
    and check a large portion of the GO graph. The editors version of the GO
    (gene_ontology_write.obo) contains additional metadata, including provenance of
    graph links. Every week, the GO pipeline executes a process which first removes
    all links tagged as "is_inferred". The reasoner then generates a list of inferred
    links which are automatically added to the ontology with the "is_inferred" tag
    set. The pipeline generates a report describing which links have changed as a
    part of this process.

  description: |-
    LIFEdb is a database that was created to manage the experimental data
    produced by the German Cancer Research Institute (DKFZ) and its collaborators,
    from work on cDNAs contained in the German cDNA Consortium collection.

    A novel cloning technology was used to rapidly generate N- and C-terminal green fluorescent
    protein fusions of cDNAs to examine the intracellular localizations of expressed
    fusion proteins in living cells. GO Cellular Component terms are manually assigned
    by curators studying fluorescence microscope images of cells labelled with GFP-fused
    cDNAs. Protein coding regions of novel full length cDNAs are tagged with the
    coding sequence of the green fluorescent protein, the fusion proteins are then
    expressed and analyzed for their subcellular localization.

    Prior to February 2013, all LIFEdb annotations were referenced by PMID: 11256614 (Simpson et al.
    2000 EMBO Rep. 1:287-292), a paper describing the protein subcellular localization

  title: OBSOLETE Taxon constraints to detect inconsistencies in annotation and ontology
    structure.
  description: |-
    GO is intended to cover the full range of species, therefore GO terms are defined
    to be taxon neutral, avoiding reliance on taxon information for full definition
    of the given process, function, or component. For certain terms, however, there
    is obvious implicit taxon specificity, such that the term should only be used
    to categorize gene products from particular species. Taxon specificity of GO terms
    is captured using relationships such as "only_in_taxon" and "never_in_taxon".
    All taxon constraints are inherited by sub-types and parts of the GO term they
    are applied to. Taxon constraints are used to prevent inappropriate annotations
    from being made by curators as well as to identify pre-existing annotations that
    violate the taxon constraints. Errors in annotations are automatically detected
    by looking for inconsistencies between the taxonomic origin of the annotated gene
    products and the implicit taxon specificity of the GO terms. The inconsistencies
    are passed on to curators for correction, in some cases the constraints need to
    be tightened or relaxed or the structure of the ontology needs to be adjusted.
    The taxon constraints are further described in this publication: Deegan, Dimmer
    and Mungall. BMC Bionformatics (2010) Formalization of taxon-based constraints
    to detect inconsistencies in annotaiton and ontology development. (PMID:20973947).

  title: OBSOLETE Gene Ontology annotation by SEA-PHAGE biocurators
  description: |-
    This GO reference describes the criteria used by biocurators of the SEA-PHAGE
    consortium for the annotation of predicted gene products from newly sequenced
    bacteriophage genomes in the SEA-PHAGE phagesdb.org and other databases and in
    the GenBank records periodically released to NCBI for these genomes. In particular,
    this GO reference describes the criteria used to assign evidence codes ISS, ISA,
    ISO, ISM, IGC and ND. To assign ISS, ISA, ISO and ISM evidence codes, SEA-PHAGE
    biocurators use a varied array of bioinformatics tools to establish homology and
    conservation of sequence and structure functional determinants with proteins from
    multiple organisms with published association to experimental GO terms and lacking
    NOT qualifiers. These proteins are referenced in the WITH field of the annotation
    using their xref database accession. The primary tools for homology search in
    ISS, ISA, ISO and ISM assignments are BLASTP and HHpred, using a maximum e-value
    of 10^-7 for BLASTP and a minimum probability of 0.9 for HHpred, and manual inspection
    of alignments in both cases. For ISS and ISA assignments, BLASTP alignments are
    required to have at least 75% coverage and 30% identity. For ISO assignments,
    orthology is further validated using reciprocal BLASTP with the identified hit.
    For HHpred results, ISS or ISM annotations are made only if the source for the
    original GO annotation explicitly defines a matched domain function, or if more
    than half of the domains of the query protein are identified in the matching protein.
    All ISS, ISA, ISO and ISM assignments entail the manual verification of the source
    for the GO term in the matching protein sequence and critical curator assessment
    of the likelihood of preservation of function, process or component in the context
    of bacteriophage biology. IGC codes are assigned on the basis of suggestive evidence
    for function based on synteny, as inferred from whole-genome comparative analyses
    of multiple bacteriophage genomes using primarily the Phamerator software platform,
    and with special emphasis on the bacteriophage virion structure and assembly genes.
    When extensive review of published literature on putative homologs reveals no
    experimental evidence of function, component or process for a particular gene
    product, it is assigned an ND evidence code and annotated to the root term for
    Cellular Component, Molecular Function and Biological Process. As part of the
    review process for assignment of ISS, ISA, ISO, IGC and ISM evidence codes, SEA-PHAGE
    curators are required to analyze the reference literature for identified matches
    and shall perform GO annotations with appropriate evidence codes if these were
    not available.

    gene models in the target genome are translated and processed by OrthoMCL 1.4
    together with reference protein sequences to produce clusters of gene products
    derived from orthologous genes. For each cluster, GO terms are automatically transferred

    to establish and manually validate function or homology to gene products. In particular,
    this GO reference describes the criteria used to make annotations based on evidence
    codes ISS, ISA, ISO, ISM and IGC. To perform ISS-, ISA-, and ISO-based annotations
    on a gene product, CACAO biocurators use sequence- and structure-based search
    algorithms (e.g. BLASTP, HHPred) to establish homology, conservation of sequence
    and structure functional determinants between the target gene product and gene
    products from other organisms with published GO annotations supported by experimental
    codes and lacking NOT qualifiers. These gene products are referenced in the WITH
    field of the annotation using their xref database accession. ISM-based annotations
    make use of published computational methods (e.g. TMHMM, SignalP) to predict gene
    product structure, localization or function. IGC-based annotations are made on
    the basis of suggestive evidence for function based on synteny. Parameters and
    criteria for use of all computational methods (e.g. e-value) are listed and versioned
    in the publicly available CACAO documentation (http://gowiki.tamu.edu/). Annotations

    The TFClass (http://tfclass.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de/index.jsf) database provides
    a comprehensive classification of mammalian DNA binding transcription factors
    (DbTFs) based on their DNA binding domains (DBDs) (PMID:29087517). TFClass classifies
    mammalian DbTFs by a five-level classification in which the four highest levels
    represent groups defined by structural and sequence similarities (superclass,
    class, family, subfamily, and genera) (more details at
    http://www.edgar-wingender.de/TFClass_schema.html). This classification is based on
    the combination of background knowledge of the molecular structural features of DBDs
    (PMID:9340487, PMID:23427989) and phylogenetic trees constructed via multiple sequence
    alignment with hierarchical clustering of manually validated DBDs and/or full-length
    protein sequences retrieved from UniProt (PMID:23427989, PMID:23180794, PMID:23427989).

    The NTNU curation team has evaluated each family and assigned a molecular function
    annotation, GO:0000981 (DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase
    II-specific), and a cellular component annotation GO:0000790 (nuclear chromatin),
    as appropriate. The superclass/class/family or subfamily ID is specified in the

  title: Manual transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to homologous
    complexes by curator judgment of sequence, composition and function similarity
  description: |-
    Method for transferring manual annotations to an entry based on a curator's judgment
    of its similarity to a putative homolog that has annotations that are supported
    with experimental evidence. Annotations are created when a curator judges that
    the sequence, composition and function of a complex shows high similarity to another
    complex that has annotation(s) supported by experimental evidence (and therefore
    display one of the evidence codes ECO:0000353 [IPI] or ECO:0005543). Annotations
    resulting from the transfer of GO terms display the ECO:0005610, ECO:0005544 or
    ECO:0005546 evidence codes and include an accession for the complex from which
    the annotation was projected in the 'with/from' field (column 8). This field MUST
    contain a Complex Portal accession identifier. Putative homologs are chosen using
    information combined from a variety of complementary sources. Potential homologs
    are initially identified using sequence similarity search programs such as BLAST.
    Homologous relationships are then verified manually using a combination of resources
    including sequence analysis tools, phylogenetic and comparative genomics databases
    such as Ensembl Compara, INPARANOID and OrthoMCL, as well as other specialised
    databases such as species-specific collections (e.g. HGNC's HCOP). In all cases
    curators check the alignments for each complex component and use their experience
    to assess whether similarity is considered to be strong enough to infer that the
    two proteins have a common function so that they can confidently project an annotation.
    While there is no fixed cut-off point in percentage sequence similarity, generally
    proteins which have greater than 70% identity that covers greater than 90% of
    the length of both proteins are examined further. Whilst we expect subunit composition
    to be conserved between closely related species, this is not an absolute rule
    and orthologous complexes may differ if a subunit cannot be traced in one species
    or is experimentally shown not to be present. When there is evidence of multiple
    paralogs for a single species, multiple variants of the complex can be inferred.

    that are regularly annotated with Rfam families using the Infernal software (PMID:24008419).
    When a non-coding RNA sequence is matched to one or more Rfam families by sequence
    similarity, the GO terms associated with the Rfam family are transitively assigned
    to the non-coding RNA sequence. Annotations resulting from the transfer of GO
    terms are assigned the ECO:0000256 evidence code (match to sequence model evidence
    used in automatic assertion) and include RNAcentral and Rfam accessions. The annotations
    are available on the GOA and EMBL-EBI FTP sites. The mapping between Rfam families
    and GO terms is available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/rfam2go,
    and the Infernal software can be downloaded at http://eddylab.org/infernal. To

  title: Automatic Gene Ontology annotation based on Rhea mapping.
  description: |-
    Rhea (https://www.rhea-db.org/, PMID:30272209) is an expert-curated knowledgebase
    of chemical and transport reactions of biological interest - and the standard
    for enzyme and transporter annotation in UniProtKB (PMID:31688925). Rhea uses
    the chemical dictionary ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) to describe
    reaction participants and their chemical transformations in a computationally
    tractable manner. GO terms corresponding to Rhea reactions are assigned a Rhea
    database cross-reference. The corresponding GO term is automatically applied to
    all UniProt entries annotated with a Rhea reaction. The mapping file is available
    at: http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/external2go/rhea2go.

  title: Electronic Gene Ontology annotations created by ARBA machine learning models
  description: |-
    Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA) predicts Gene Ontology (GO) terms among
    other types of functional annotation such as Protein Description (DE), Keywords
    (KW), Enzyme Commission numbers (EC), subcellular LOcation (LO), etc. For all
    annotation types, reviewed UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot records having manual annotations
    as reference data are used to perform the machine learning phase and generate
    prediction models. For GO terms, ARBA has an additional feature to augment reference
    data using the relations between GO terms in the GO graph. The data augmentation
    is based on adding more general annotations into records containing manual GO
    terms, which will result in richer reference data. The predicted GO terms are
    then propagated to all unreviewed UniProtKB/TrEMBL proteins that meet the conditions
    of ARBA models. GO annotations using this technique receive the evidence code
    Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA; ECO:0000501). Links: ARBA documentation

  title: TreeGrafter-generated GO annotations
  description: |-
    TreeGrafter is a software tool for annotating protein sequences using pre-annotated
    PANTHER phylogenetic trees. TreeGrafter takes an input query protein sequence,
    finds the best matching homologous family, and then grafts it to the best location
    in the tree. It then annotates the query sequence by propagating annotations from
    the appropriate ancestral node(s) in the reference tree, which were manually annotated
    using the PAN-GO method (see GOREF_0000033). This method is integrated into InterProScan,
    which produces annotations to millions of genes across tens of thousands of organisms.

    The full method is described in PMID:30032202.

  title: Automated transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to 
    mouse-human orthologs.
  description: |-
    The Alliance of Genome Resources (https://www.alliancegenome.org/) has procedures in 
    place to establish orthology relationships between genes. The experimentally-based 
    annotations (IDA, IMP IPI, IGI, and EXP) for human genes generated by the GOA pipeline 
    are used to provide annotations to the respective mouse orthologs, and given the ISO 
    evidence code and an entry in the "With (or) From" field to indicate the orthologous 
    entity.
